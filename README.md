# FAQ

For my final project, I installed laravel cashier and created a payment gateway using stripe for users who want to subscribe to get access to more content.
All they have to do is pay the $10 fee and they will have access to unlimted content for 90 days.

-The user will click the subcription button on the menu bar.
-The user will then click on make payment.
-The user will be directed to a page where they put in their card details.

To test that the stripe payment feature is working, we will use a stripe test visa card number 
    -4242 4242 4242 4242
You may then put in random numbers for the expiration, cvv and zipcode.

When card details have been proccesed, the user will be redirected back to the home page.
